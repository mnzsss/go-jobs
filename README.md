# Go Jobs

The CRUD Project with GORM, PostgreSQL, Gin, Gin-Swagger, Swag, Makefile, Docker, and Docker Compose for study purposes about Go.

## Overview

This project implements a CRUD in Go using the following technologies:

On start, this project implements a CRUD in Go using the following technologies:

- üóÉÔ∏è **GORM:** ORM (Object Relational Mapper) for interacting with the PostgreSQL database. 
- üêò **PostgreSQL:** Relational database used to store CRUD data. 
- üåê **Gin:** Web framework for building APIs in Go. 
- üìö **Gin-Swagger:** Middleware for integrating Swagger with the Gin API. 
- üìñ **Swag:** Tool for generating Swagger documentation for Go APIs.
- üõ†Ô∏è **Makefile:** Simplifies common development tasks.
- üê≥ **Docker:** Containerization for isolation and distribution of the application.
- üö¢ **Docker Compose:** Container orchestration for development environments.

## Installation

Ensure you have Go, Docker, and Docker Compose installed on your system.

### Swag (Swagger) Installation

```bash
# Install Swag globally
go get -u github.com/swaggo/swag/cmd/swag

# Add Go's path to your shell (bash or zsh)
export PATH=$PATH:$(go env GOPATH)/bin
export PATH=$PATH:$(go env GOROOT)/bin
```

Need improvements to auto generate the Swagger documentation on change files inside docker, but for now, you can run the command below to generate the Swagger documentation:  

```bash
make docs
```

And up docker compose again.

### Locally

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/mnzsss/go-jobs.git

# 2. Navigate to the project directory
cd go-jobs

# 3. Setup the environment variables
cp .env.example .env

# 4. Run the application locally
# By default the application will run on port 8080 with run-with-docs command
make
```

### Docker

Run docker compose with Auto Rebuilding:

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/mnzsss/go-jobs.git

# 2. Navigate to the project directory
cd go-jobs

# 3. Run the application using Docker Compose
docker-compose up
```

Access the Swagger route in the container: [Local Docs](http://localhost:8080/swagger/index.html)

### Makefile Tasks

Here are some common tasks you can perform using the Makefile:

- `make run`: Run the Go application locally.
- `make run-with-docs`: Run the Go application with Swagger documentation.
- `make build`: Build the Go application.
- `make test`: Run tests for the project.
- `make docs`: Generate Swagger documentation for the API.
- `make clean`: Clean up generated files and artifacts.
